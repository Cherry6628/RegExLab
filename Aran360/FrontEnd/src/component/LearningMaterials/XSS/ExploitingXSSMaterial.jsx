          <h1>Exploiting cross-site scripting vulnerabilities</h1>
          <p>
            The traditional way to prove that you've found a cross-site
            scripting vulnerability is to create a popup using the{" "}
            <span>alert()</span> function. This isn't because XSS has anything
            to do with popups; it's simply a way to prove that you can execute
            arbitrary JavaScript on a given domain. You might notice some people
            using <span>alert(document.domain)</span>. This is a way of making
            it explicit which domain the JavaScript is executing on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes you'll want to go further and prove that an XSS
            vulnerability is a real threat by providing a full exploit. In this
            section, we'll explore three of the most popular and powerful ways
            to exploit an XSS vulnerability.

          <h1>Exploiting cross-site scripting to steal cookies</h1>
          <p>
            Stealing cookies is a traditional way to exploit XSS. Most web
            applications use cookies for session handling. You can exploit
            cross-site scripting vulnerabilities to send the victim's cookies to
            your own domain, then manually inject the cookies into the browser
            and impersonate the victim.
          </p>
          <p>In practice, this approach has some significant limitations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The victim might not be logged in.</li>
            <li>
              Many applications hide their cookies from JavaScript using the{" "}
              <span>HttpOnly</span> flag.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sessions might be locked to additional factors like the user's IP
              address.
            </li>
            <li>The session might time out before you're able to hijack it.</li>

          <h1>Exploiting cross-site scripting to capture passwords</h1>
          <p>
            These days, many users have password managers that auto-fill their
            passwords. You can take advantage of this by creating a password
            input, reading out the auto-filled password, and sending it to your
            own domain. This technique avoids most of the problems associated
            with stealing cookies, and can even gain access to every other
            account where the victim has reused the same password.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary disadvantage of this technique is that it only works on
            users who have a password manager that performs password auto-fill.
            (Of course, if a user doesn't have a password saved you can still
            attempt to obtain their password through an on-site phishing attack,
            but it's not quite the same.)

          <h1>Exploiting cross-site scripting to bypass CSRF protections</h1>
          <p>
            XSS enables an attacker to do almost anything a legitimate user can
            do on a website. By executing arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's
            browser, XSS allows you to perform a wide range of actions as if you
            were the victim user. For example, you might make a victim send a
            message, accept a friend request, commit a backdoor to a source code
            repository, or transfer some Bitcoin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some websites allow logged-in users to change their email address
            without re-entering their password. If you've found an XSS
            vulnerability on one of these sites, you can exploit it to steal a
            CSRF token. With the token, you can change the victim's email
            address to one that you control. You can then trigger a password
            reset to gain access to the account.
          </p>
          <p>
            This type of exploit combines XSS (to steal the CSRF token) with the
            functionality typically targeted by CSRF. While traditional CSRF is
            a "one-way" vulnerability, where the attacker can induce the victim
            to send requests but cannot see the responses, XSS enables "two-way"
            communication. This enables the attacker to both send arbitrary
            requests and read the responses, resulting in a hybrid attack that
            bypasses anti-CSRF defenses.
          </p>

            <h3>Note</h3>
            <p>
              CSRF tokens are ineffective against XSS because XSS lets attackers
              read token values directly from responses.
